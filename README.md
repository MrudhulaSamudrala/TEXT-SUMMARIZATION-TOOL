## DESCRIPTION 

Text summarization is the process of condensing a large body of text into a shorter version while preserving its key information and meaning. It is widely used in various domains such as journalism, legal documentation, research papers, and news aggregation.

There are two primary types of text summarization:

Extractive Summarization: Selects key sentences or phrases directly from the original text.

Abstractive Summarization: Generates a summary by rephrasing and restructuring the content in a new way, similar to how humans summarize.

In this project we will mainly focus on Abstractive Text Summarization specifically designed for product reviews, generating concise and meaningful summaries to help users quickly understand key insights from customer feedback. 

**Background and Motivation**:
In today's digital age, text summarization simplifies information overload by condensing content using NLP. This project enhances accessibility and productivity by integrating extractive and abstractive methods. Leveraging BERT and Seq2Seq with attention, it delivers accurate, context aware summaries for efficient content consumption.

**Tools for Text Summarization** :
Various tools and libraries are available to implement text summarization, both extractive and abstractive.Here, we build a model for Abstractive summarization using RNN neural network and LSTM as well as For Extractive summarization by using Bert model.

**For Extractive text summarization** :

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) – Extracts the most important sentences from the text using attention-based embeddings.

The summarizer library is a Python package that leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for extractive text summarization.

**For Abstractive Summarization** :

Core Libraries : NumPy, Pandas, re, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Matplotlib, Scikit learn

Deep Learning Libraries :TensorFlow/Keras, Tokenizer, Pad Sequences, AttentionLayer

Model Architecture : Seq2Seq, LSTM, Attention Mechanism, Embedding, TimeDistributed Layer

Training and Evaluation : EarlyStopping, Sparse Categorical Crossentropy.

Text Preprocessing : Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, Text Cleaning, Padding and Truncation


The selected technology stack for the abstractive summarization task is designed to leverage the strengths of deep learning and attention mechanisms

BeautifulSoup: BeautifulSoup is used for parsing HTML content and extracting text, which is crucial for cleaning and preprocessing web based data.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK provides robust tools for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stopwords removal, which are critical for preparing text data.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is used for data visualization, such as plotting histograms of word counts, to gain insights into the dataset.

Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is used for splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, ensuring proper model evaluation.

TensorFlow/Keras: TensorFlow/Keras provides a high level API for building and training deep learning models. It is used here to implement the Seq2Seq model with LSTM and attention mechanisms.

Attention Mechanism: The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text when generating the summary, improving the quality and coherence of the generated summaries.

LSTM (Long Short Term Memory): LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that captures long term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for text generation tasks.

Early Stopping: Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting by stopping training when the validation loss stops improving.

**Applications of Text Summarization**
1. News Summarization – Condenses news articles for quick reading (e.g., Google News).
   
2. Legal Document Summarization – Extracts key points from contracts and case laws.
   
3. Chatbots & Virtual Assistants – Summarizes conversations for customer support (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
   
4. Medical Reports – Helps doctors review patient history and research papers.
   
5. Financial Documents – Summarizes stock reports and financial statements.
    
6. Academic Papers – Extracts highlights from research papers (e.g., Arxiv, Google Scholar).
    
7. Social Media – Summarizes trending topics and discussions (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).
    
8. E-commerce Reviews – Summarizes product reviews for quick decision-making.
    
9. Meeting Notes – Condenses long meetings into action points (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet).
    
10. Code Documentation – Generates concise explanations for programming code (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
